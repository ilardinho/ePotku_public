MCERD TODO
    - removed hard coded "gas atoms": Update: done, not tested well. Isotope issue remains to be solved. Update2: limitations found, possibly fixed
    - implement new physics to jibal and/or mcerd
        - screened cross sections (Kai) - part of jibal?
        - faster heavy ion simulations (especially of substrate signal) by changing step size, currently < 1Ã… steps are possible for high Z and low E (Kai)
    - fix scattering/recoiling absolute yields (Kai)
        - benchmark against SimNRA
    - sane version numbering, home page, binary distributions etc.
    - implement testing (CTest?) and some basic tests
    - add copyright and copying information (GPL?)
    - copy files to a new repository to erase all git history, push to GitHub
    - make sure Potku uses this version (git submodule)
