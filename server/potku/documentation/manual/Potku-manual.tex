\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Purpose}
Potku is a graphical user interface for analysis and visualization of a ToF-ERD telescope's measurement data. For physics calculations Potku uses external analysis components.

The Potku software can draw the data points received from the telescope into a histogram, allow the user to select chemical elements from the histogram, and use the selected elements to produce elemental losses histograms, energy spectrum histograms and depth profile histograms.

The software was developed with Python 3.3, PyQt and MatplotLib. External analysis components are written in C.

\section{Installation}
The installation instructions can be found in the downloaded package as installing_instructions.txt file.

%%%%%%%%%%%%% HOW TO - PROJECT
%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{How To Make A Project}\label{howto-project}
To create a new project user selects create a new project from main window after starting Potku or new project from menubar. 
Both of these will open a dialog, shown in Section \ref{projectdialog}, where user has to set the name and location of the project.
The project requires a name which has to be a valid format for a folder name, since all measurements will be saved there.
The project is saved to user's documents folder by default but this can be changed by unchecking ''Use default'' and browsing to a new location.
The default folder can be changed in global settings, shown in Section \ref{globalsettings}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%% HOW TO - ADD MEASUREMENT (LOAD/IMPORT)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{How To Add Measurement To A Project}\label{howto-measurement}
Adding a new measurement to a project after creating, Section \ref{howto-project}, or opening a project will happen through loading or importing measurement, which can be found in menubar Section \ref{menubar}.
Loading a measurement is straightforward process where user has to browse to measurement's .asc file location and load it.
Importing a measurement, Section \ref{howto-measurement-import}, process imports raw measurement information from a ToF-E measuring unit into an .asc file used by Potku.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%% HOW TO - IMPORT MEASUREMENT
%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{How To Import Measurement To A Project}\label{howto-measurement-import}
After saving a raw measurement data file(s) from a ToF-E measuring unit; these can imported using import dialog, Section \ref{importdialog}.
After adding the files to the list of measurements-to-be-imported. Potku will automatically seek the first line of the actual data and different ADC triggers found in the file.
Suitable coincidence timing for ADC channel(s) can be selected via the coincidence timing preview window, Section \ref{importprevdialog}.
User can select the suitable range, which is around the highest peak where the most coincidences happen, with the manual selection tool.
User can then select from predefined options what columns will be imported. By default the default ADC channels will be included.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%% HOW TO - SETTINGS
%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{How To Set Measurement Settings}\label{howto-settings}
Changing the measurement units parameters for project happens in Project Settings window. You can find this button in main window of Potku, Section \ref{mainwindow}.
Content of the window is explained in Section \ref{projectsettings}.
If user has a measurement open and wants to change settings for this specific measurement, the button for this can be found under Settings as Measurement shown in Section \ref{measurementtab}.
The window is slightly different compared to the Project Settings' and is therefore explained in Section \ref{measurement-measurementsettings}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%% HOW TO - ELEMENT SELECTION
%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{How To Make An Element Selection}\label{howto-elemselect}
After adding a measurement to a project as explained in Section \ref{howto-measurement}. User has to make or load an elemental selection.
The ToF-E histogram's tools are explained in Section \ref{measurementtab-tofe}.
To make an element selection user has to use the element selection tool. 
To make the selection user has to surround the wanted element by clicking around it on the graph.
To close the selection user can either right click or click on the first node of the selection.
After closing the selection user is greeted element selection settings window, explained in Section \ref{measurement-tofe-element}, for the made selection. 
The selections are automatically saved inside the measurement's directory in the project directory. 
Be careful when deleting one or all selections as there is no way to revert this action.
If the user wants to use selections made in another measurement, these can be loaded by either clicking load selections or right clicking the ToF-E histogram for a menu.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%% HOW TO - TOF-E CALIBRATION
%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{How To Do ToF-E Calibration}\label{howto-calib}
First user has to make or load element selections to an open measurement, Section \ref{howto-measurement}.
Secondly has to save these selections to cut files. This can be done by clicking ''Save cuts'' button in the ToF-E histogram window or via right click menu on the graph.
ToF-E calibration window can be opened from project settings, Section \ref{projectsettings}, or measurement specific calibration settings windows, Section \ref{measurementtab}.

The main elements of calibration window are described in the Sections \ref{measurement-tofe-calib-curve} and \ref{measurement-tofe-calib-linear}.
In Fitting tab the project's measurements and the cut files of them are listed.
ToF-E calibration requires a linear fitting from selected front edge estimations.
In Fitting tab user selects a cut file and a curve fitting graph is drawn from it.
Potku will automatically attempt to find the front edge of the element.
However, this will not always yield good result and user has to manually select it and/or changing bin width.
When the front edge estimation seems to be correct, clicking the ''Accept Point'' will include the estimation for linear fitting.
After all suitable front edges of cut files are accepted it is time to check linear fitting in the Calibration tab.

Calibration tab shows a linear fitting for all accepted front edges. 
The window elements are described in the Section \ref{measurement-tofe-calib-linear}.
Use can choose which of the points will be used for linear fitting by checking and unchecking them.
The graph will show old ToF-E calibration, if such exist, so user can then compare new calibration to the previous one.
There should always be a minimum of three points for the calibration. Otherwise it is unreliable.
Once all points are aligned in a line, user can accept the calibration by pressing ''Accept calibration'' button and close the window.
Calibration parameters should now show in the settings window where ToF-E calibration subwindow was opened from.

%%%%%%%%%%%%% HOW TO - ELEMENTAL LOSSES
%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{How To Make An Elemental Losses}\label{howto-elemloss}
First user has to make or load element selections to an open measurement, Section \ref{howto-measurement}.
Secondly has to save these selections to cut files. This can be done by clicking ''Save cuts'' button in the ToF-E histogram window or via right click menu on the graph.
User can proceed to make elemental losses graph by clicking ''Elemental Losses'' on the sidebar, Section \ref{measurementtab}, or if they prefer to use menubar, Section \ref{menubar}.

In the dialog for elemental losses, described in the Section \ref{measurement-dialogelemloss}, user can select all cut files from the measurement to be used.
The heaviest element of the cut files should always be chosen for reference cut file.
User can define into how many splits are cut files split based on the reference cut file.
Y axis scaling can be done from zero to maximum value or from minimum to maximum.

Elemental losses are then calculated and shown in the Elemental Losses graph, described in the Section \ref{measurementtab-elemloss}.
From here user can save all the splits by pressing ''Save splits' button.
Splits can be useful in certain cases and user might want to use them instead of the original cut file.

Secondly has to save these selections to cut files. This can be done by clicking ''Save cuts'' button in the ToF-E histogram window or via right click menu on the graph.
User should make sure that the measurement unit, Section \ref{howto-settings}, and ToF-E calibration, Section \ref{howto-calib}, settings are properly set before continuing further.
User can proceed to make energy spectrum graph by clicking ''Energy Spectrum'' on the sidebar, Section \ref{measurementtab}, or if they prefer to use menubar, Section \ref{menubar}.

In the dialog for energy spectrum, described in the Section \ref{measurement-dialogenergy}, user can define histogram bin width and select all cut files from the measurement to be used.
After generating Energy Spectrum, a window will be added to measurement's tab and its content is described in Section \ref{measurementtab-energy}.

First user has to make or load element selections to an open measurement, Section \ref{howto-measurement}.
Secondly has to save these selections to cut files. This can be done by clicking ''Save cuts'' button in the ToF-E histogram window or via right click menu on the graph.
User should make sure that the measurement unit, Section \ref{howto-settings}, and ToF-E calibration, Section \ref{howto-calib}, settings are properly set before continuing further.
User can proceed to make depth profile graph by clicking ''Depth Profile'' on the sidebar, Section \ref{measurementtab}, or if they prefer to use menubar, Section \ref{menubar}.

In the dialog for depth profile, described in the Section \ref{measurement-dialogenergy}, user can select all cut files from the measurement to be used.
The window will also provide information settings that are used to create the depth profile in case the user has forgotten to change them.

Depth profile is calculated and shown in the Depth Profile graph, described in the Section \ref{measurementtab-depth}.
User can change the plotting from absolute to relative and adjust the boundaries via the tool which define the area that is affected.
