14.11.2016: Possibly appearing bug: if installed as admininstrator in windows, but used from differnt account->no .matplotlib have been created to user accounts\  where "fontList.py3k.cache" is being read


Urgent
------
***minimum 5 iterations for depth profile if heavy beam-haevy substrate (ie Cu beam to GaAs)
**software version/date needs to be seen from the help menu etc more easily
**Element Sm samarinium is missing from the selection table of elements
**in some situations ?? before save?? the number of events in the cut area changes if mouse is hovering over the area->before save cuts and during the first time, when data is open and cuts are saved during that time.->but if selections are loaded, will not occur
**Separate treatment for different recoil elements from primary beam (same as separate treatment for individual isotopes??)
**BUG!***Lecquyer scattering correction only valid for angles>90 degrees (not valid thing for the ERDA) ->remove option
**is the long filenames still a problem in the import?
** is the uppoer/lower case still a problem in the file import or elsewhere? windows filenames should be case insestive
**is there still a problem if previous data/file has been on a network drive which is not available on the new potku opening->potku cannot start??
**same problem as above(?) potku cannot start if default folders are in the network which are not available when opening the potku->potku cannot start at all ->>should ignore and give error/warning to the user that cannot access the files!!
**There has been issues in histogram zooming to level 5->crash is this still the case???
**BUG!!!***Absolute concentrations (1e15 at/cm2) are calculated incorrectly when nm depth scale is selected. Probably integration is also done in nm when it should still be done in absolute depth units.
**ToF-Calibration offset defaults should be like 1 for the slope and 1 for the offset (ALSO neithor of these cannot be axcatly zero!)


 - develop testing scheme
 - separate treatment for different isotopes (1H/2H, 6Li/7Li)
 - improve manual
 - write FAQ
 - write TODO (this file)


Performance improvements
------------------------
**Option to regard events with long or shor tof, high or low E, (only surface data is opened/used)
**Import_is_SLOOW (AWK etc)!!
 - reading data takes a lot of time!
 - selecting events for cuts **+saving or loading those takes huge amount of time

Short term development
----------------------
**project filename addition ,should be possible to give short sample identifier-which could come to visible to figures too
** SUM depth profiles to 100% ->>now works wrong at depth < 0. Should be done so that at depth 0 and <1 or even <10-30  those values are used which are calculated, and then only normalization is done for depth values >10-30
** Better legend box, X,Y axis linewidtsh ->>constant values, also for the axis legends
**All graphs should have filename option as a default on, so that filename is visible on the top right corner of the image
**Better quality "save figure" as for the histogram and depth profiles etc->report ready-quoality required.
**Also Energy spectra sclae should be able to give manyal X-Yaxis limits, like in the histogram, now only manual mouse zoom.
**Histogram X-Y limits as default option somethign else than the full data range
**Energy efficiency files sould be possible to be selected a particular filename ,not just H1.eff  but like H1_date_parameters.eff <-manual selection what to use
**Energy spectra exports data to files as default
**Energy spectra export: option to select->stack all selected spectra also in a single spectra (for simnra etc usage?)

 - better default color allocation for materials
    · pick colors from a palette for elements which don't have a default color
 - element 'Ref' for composition changes
 - generate sum data with reduced event number for master-slave analysis
 - improve terminology
    · ERD/RBS -> REC/SCT
 - import old FastCom format
 - residuals for ToF-calibration figure

Medium term development
-----------------------
*** Single scattered primary beam selection, two or more elements.. (Eg. Cu beam to InGaAs) ->In at highest E, then Ga+AS
*** Composition changes can do fitting to elemental losses->full statistics can be used, but the fitting function corrects the loss durign the measurement
 - efficiency calibration procedure
 - reading and writing compressed files
 - multi-threading, progress bars
 - conversion to mass scale
    · iterative automatic calibration by pointin 1-3 elements
 - display and selection for more/other than TOF/E
    · ToF-channel, E-channel, ToF-calib, E-calib, mass, depth, timing,
      position, gas detector signals
    · position
    · gas detector signals
 - display cursor value in different units than figure
    · ToF-channel, E-channel, ToF-calib, E-calib, mass, depth, timing etc.
 - indicate if related graphs are not up to date
 - rewrite tof_list

Long term development
---------------------
 - automatic mass/elemental selection
    · each event distributed according to the probabilities
    · analyze and quantify background
 - MCERD integration
 - real time analysis
