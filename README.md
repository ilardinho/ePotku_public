# ePotku

ePotku is a web version of [Potku](https://github.com/JYU-IBA/potku). It is used for time-of-flight elastic recoil detection analysis (ToF-ERDA).

The server can be run on Windows, Linux and macOS. Supported browsers are Firefox and Chrome.

# Getting started

Instructions for installing the backend and frontend are listed in their respective subfolders' READMEs. Starting with backend instructions is recommended.

# About Project ePotku
ePotku project developed a single-page web application (SPA) version of [Potku](https://github.com/JYU-IBA/potku) at the University of Jyv채skyl채 in 2020. Potku (Finnish: kick, recoil), originally developed as a software project in 2013, is an open source analysis software for time-of-flight elastic recoil detection analysis (ToF-ERDA) measurement data. In ToF-ERDA, focused ion beams are used to investigate samples' elemental compositions. It was further expanded with a Monte-Carlo ERD simulation functionality by the Monisiro project in 2018.

ePotku can be used to create depth profiles, energy spectra and composition changes from ToF-ERDA measurement data. Computationally intensive calculations are offloaded to the server, speeding up analysis.

ePotku is also portable: one can work on a single request on multiple devices without having to manually move files. This also enables easy sharing of open data.

The front-end side ePotku was created with JavaScript, Vue.js and Plotly.js. The back-end utilizes Python 3.7, Flask, SQL and existing Potku code.
